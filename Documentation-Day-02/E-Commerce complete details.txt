1)Frontend UI as we all know that UI is the most essential part of our project that attracts users to use our website "Better the UI More the users". It is the most hybrid part on our coding journey to make UI perfect.

2)Sanity CMS is a headless content management system designed for developers and content creators to build and manage digital content efficiently.  Its API-first approach ensures that content can be easily integrated into websites, applications, and other digital experiences, making it a popular choice for modern web development. With real-time collaboration features, a powerful query language (GROQ), and an intuitive user interface, Sanity enables teams to create, edit, and deliver content across various platforms seamlessly.

3)A third-party API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allows developers to access and integrate external services or data from other companies or platforms into their own applications. These APIs enable developers to leverage existing functionalities, such as payment processing, social media interactions, or data storage, without having to build those features from scratch. By using third-party APIs, developers can enhance their applications, streamline development processes, and provide users with richer experiences while saving time and resources.
